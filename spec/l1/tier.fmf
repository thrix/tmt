summary: Name of the tier set this test belongs to

stories:
    As a tester testing a security advisory I want to run the
    stable set of important tests which cover the most essential
    functionality and can provide test results in a short time.

description:
    It's quite common to organize tests into "tiers" based on
    their importance, stability, duration and other aspects. For
    this tags have been used quite often as there was not
    corresponding attribute available. It might make sense to have
    a dedicated field for this functionality as well. Should be a
    ``string``.

examples: |
    tier: 1
