summary: allow disabling individual tests

decription:
    When a test is broken and it is not possible to fix it immediately
    there should be an easy way how to temporarily mark it as disabled
    so that it's skipped during the test suite execution.

story:
    - As a developer/tester I want selected tests to be skipped during
      test execution by marking them as disabled.

examples: |
    disabled: yes

notes:
    The default value is "disabled: no".

type: boolean
