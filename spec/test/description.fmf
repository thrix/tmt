summary: Detailed description of what the test does

story:
    As a tester I come to a test code I wrote 10 years ago (so I
    have absolutely no idea about it) and would like to quickly
    understand what it does.

    - As a developer I review existing test coverage for my component
      and would like to get an overall idea what is covered without
      having to read the whole test code.

decription:
    For complex tests it makes sense to provide more detailed
    description to better clarify what is covered by the test.

        This test checks all available wget options related to
        downloading files recursively. First a tree directory
        structure is created for testing. Then a file download
        is performed for different recursion depth specified by
        the "--level=depth" option.
