summary: specify how test result should be interpreted

decription:
    Even if a test fails it might makes sense to execute it to be able
    to manually review the results (ignore test result) or ensure the
    behaviour has not unexpectedly changed and the test is still failing
    (expected fail).

story:
    - As a developer I have a test, I know it's failing for now, yet I
      want to have it for future reference.
    - As a tester I want to regularly execute the test but temporarily
      ignore test result until more investigation is done and the test
      can be fixed properly.

notes:
    The following values should be supported:
    - respect: test result is respected (fails when test failed)
    - ignore: ignore the test result (test always passes)
    - xfail: expected fail (pass when test fails, fail when test passes)

examples: |
    result: ignore

notes:
    The default value is "result: respect".
