summary: maximum time for test execution

decription:
    In order to prevent stuck tests consuming resources we define a
    maximum time for test execution. If the limit is exceeded the
    running test is killed by the test harness.

story:
    - As a developer/tester I want to prevent resource wasting by stuck
      tests.
    - As a test harness I need to know after how long time I should kill
      test if it is still running.

notes:
    Use the same format as the "sleep" command. For example: 3m, 2h, 1d.

examples: |
    duration: 5m
