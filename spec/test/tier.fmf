summary: name of the tier set this test belongs to

decription:
    It's quite common to organize tests into "tiers" based on their
    importance, stability, duration and other aspects. For this tags
    have been used quite often as there was not corresponding attribute
    available. It might make sense to have a dedicated field for this
    functionality as well.

stories:
    - As a tester testing a security advisory I want to run the stable
      set of important tests which cover the most essential
      functionality and can provide test results in a short time.

examples: |
    tier: 1
