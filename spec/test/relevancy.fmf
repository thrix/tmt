summary: Test Case Relevancy rules used for filtering relevant test cases

decription:
    Sometimes a test case is only relevant for specific environment.
    Test Case Relevancy allows to filter irrelevant test cases out.

story:
    - As a tester I want to skip execution of a particular test case in
      given test environment.

examples: |
    relevancy:
       - "distro < f-28: False"
       - "distro = rhel-7 & arch = ppc64: False"

notes: >
    Environment is defined by one or more environment dimensions such as
    product, distro, collection, variant, arch, component. Relevancy
    consists of a set of rules of the form "condition: decision".
