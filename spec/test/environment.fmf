summary: environment variables to be set before running the test

decription:
    Test scripts might require certain environment variables to be set.
    Although this can be done on the shell command line as part of the
    "test" attribute it makes sense to have a dedicated field for this,
    especially when the number of parameters grows. This might be useful
    for virtual test cases as well.

story:
    - As a tester I need to pass environment variables to my test script
      to properly execute the desired test scenario.
    - As a tester I'm using a single test script for testing different
      Python implementations specified by environment variable PYTHON.

examples: |
    environment:
        PACKAGE: python37
        PYTHON: python3.7

type: dictionary
