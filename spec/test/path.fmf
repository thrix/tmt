summary: filesystem directory to be entered before executing the test

decription:
    As the object hierarchy does not need to copy the filesystem
    structure (e.g. when using virtual test cases) we need a way how to
    define where the test is located.

story:
    - As a test writer I define two virtual test cases, both using the
      same script for executing.

notes:
    Automation is expected to change directory to provided path starting
    from the fmf tree root directory before executing the test. Use
    absolute path starting with slash. If path is not defined, object
    name (identifier) is used by default.

examples: |
    path: /protocols/https
