summary: Shell command which executes the test

story:
    As a test writer I want to run a single test script in
    multiple ways (e.g. by providing different parameters).

description:
    This attribute defines how the test is to be executed.
    Allows to parametrize a single test script and in this way
    create virtual test cases. Should be a ``string``.

examples: |
    test: ./test.sh
    test: ./test.sh --depth 1000
    test: pytest -k performance
    test: make run
