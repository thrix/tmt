summary: Filesystem directory to be entered before executing the test

story:
    As a test writer I define two virtual test cases, both using
    the same script for executing.

description:
    As the object hierarchy does not need to copy the filesystem
    structure (e.g. when using virtual test cases) we need a way
    how to define where the test is located.

    Automation is expected to change directory to provided path
    starting from the fmf tree root directory before executing the
    test. Use absolute path starting with slash. If path is not
    defined, object name (identifier) is used by default.

examples: |
    path: /protocols/https
