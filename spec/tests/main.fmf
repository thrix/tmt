story:
    As a tester I want to store test metadata close to the test
    source code.

description: |
    These test metadata are closely related to individual tests
    so it makes sense to store them directly with the test code.
    In order to use the Flexible Metadata Format effectively we
    define the essential set of attributes to be used.

    For each attribute we standardize a clear, unique and well
    chosen ``name`` and ``type`` which is string, number, list,
    dictionary or boolean. Each definition contains at least one
    apt example of the usage and a user story illustrating the
    motivation.
