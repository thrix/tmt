story:
    As a tester I want to store test metadata close to the test
    source code.

description: |
    These test metadata are closely related to individual tests
    so it makes sense to store them directly with the test code.
    For each attribute we standardize a clear, unique and well
    chosen name and type. Each definition contains at least one
    apt example of the usage and a user story illustrating the
    motivation.
