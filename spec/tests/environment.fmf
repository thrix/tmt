summary: Environment variables to be set before running the test

story:
    As a tester I need to pass environment variables to my test
    script to properly execute the desired test scenario.

description:
    Test scripts might require certain environment variables to be
    set.  Although this can be done on the shell command line as
    part of the ``test`` attribute it makes sense to have a
    dedicated field for this, especially when the number of
    parameters grows. This might be useful for virtual test cases
    as well.

examples: |
    environment:
        PACKAGE: python37
        PYTHON: python3.7

type: dictionary
