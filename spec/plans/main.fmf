story:
    As a tester I want to group tests and specify environment for
    testing.

description:
    These metadata contain information for execution of multiple
    test cases such as how the environment for testing should be
    prepared, which set of test cases is relevant for testing
    specific artifact or which frameworks should be used for
    execution.
